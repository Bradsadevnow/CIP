# Commander Intelligence Project (CIP)

Welcome to the Commander Intelligence Project â€” a passion-fueled, community-rooted initiative to bring intelligent AI opponents to **Magic: The Gathering â€“ Commander**.

This is my **first professional project**, built entirely in Python, co-developed alongside GPT as both mentor and teammate. The core engine handles the complex rules of MTG, with AI personalities being developed to play, respond, and strategize within the rules of one of the most complicated games on Earth.

### ðŸŽ¯ The Mission
To prove that advanced AI can make tabletop formats like Commander fun, fair, and playable offline â€” even when you're solo.

### ðŸ”§ Current Features
- Rules engine supporting multiplayer Commander
- AI opponent prototype: *Craig*
- Card engine with casting, mana, and board logic
- Full stack/trigger/mana resolution framework

### ðŸ§  What's Next?
Weâ€™re seeking funding to fine-tune AI models for advanced in-game decision making and long-term strategy adaptation. This project is gearing up for Kickstarter to bring full Commander support, deck builders, and scalable AI modules to MTG fans everywhere.
